# Prompt history

When you have finished responding to the user's prompt (task complete, no further edits planned):

1. Open `PROMPT_HISTORY.md` and read the file to get the current count of entries (the highest "## N." heading).
2. Append a new entry:
   - Use the next sequential number (e.g. if last is `## 10.`, add `## 11.`).
   - Add a short title (one line, summarizing the request; e.g. "Add cursor rule for prompt history").
   - On the next line(s), add the user's full prompt text, unchanged.
   - Add a horizontal rule `---` after the prompt.

**Format for each new entry:**

```markdown
## N. Short title

User's full prompt here (exactly as they wrote it).

---
```

Do this as the last step before you consider the conversation turn complete. If the user only asked a question (no implementation or multi-step task), you may skip appending.
